# 11-note-taker

![Project license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

The goal was to create an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This app uses an express backend and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file. The process involved building the application backend and connecting it with the frontend. For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.
